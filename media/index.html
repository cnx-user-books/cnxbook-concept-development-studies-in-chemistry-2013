      <h1>Foundation</h1>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp33782272">We have developed an understanding of equilibrium involving phase transitions and involving reactions entirely in the gas phase. We will assume an understanding of the principles of dynamic equilibrium, reaction equilibrium constants, and Le Ch&#226;telier's principle. To understand the application of these principles to reactions in solution, we will now assume a definition of certain classes of substances as being either acids or bases. An acid is a substance whose molecules donate positive hydrogen ions (protons) to other molecules or ions. When dissolved in pure water, acid molecules will transfer a hydrogen ion to a water molecule or to a cluster of several water molecules. This increases the concentration of H<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions in the solution. A base is a substance whose molecules accept hydrogen ions from other molecules. When dissolved in pure water, base molecules will accept a hydrogen ion from a water molecule, leaving behind an increased concentration of OH<sup class="sup">-</sup> ions in the solution. To understand what determines acid-base behavior, we will assume an understanding of the bonding, structure, and properties of individual molecules.</p>

      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp31309536">Acids and bases are very common substances whose properties vary greatly. Many acids are known to be quite corrosive, with the ability to dissolve solid metals or burn flesh. Many other acids, however, are not only benign but vital to the processes of life. Far from destroying biological molecules, they carry out reactions critical for organisms to live. Similarly, many bases are caustic cleansers while many others are medications to calm indigestion pains.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp33302736">In this Concept Development Study, we will develop an understanding of the characteristics of molecules that make them either acids or bases. We will examine measurements about the relative strengths of acids and bases, and we will use these to develop a quantitative understanding of the relative strengths of acids and bases. From this, we can develop a qualitative understanding of the properties of molecules which determine whether a molecule is a strong acid or a weak acid, a strong base or a weak base. This understanding is valuable in predicting the outcomes of reactions, based on the relative quantitative strengths of acids and bases. These reactions are commonly referred to as neutralization reactions. A surprisingly large number of reactions, particularly in organic chemistry, can be understood as transfer of hydrogen ions from acid molecules to base molecules.</p>

      <h1>Observation 1: Strong Acids and Weak Acids</h1>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp19677184">From the definition of an acid given in the Foundation, a typical acid can be written as HA, representing the hydrogen ion which will be donated and the rest of the molecule which will remain as a negative ion after the donation. The typical reaction of an acid in an aqueous solution reacting with water can be written as</p>

      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp32179472">In this reaction, the hydronium ion H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>(aq) is a notation to indicate that the donated proton has been dissolved in solution. However, experimental observations indicate that the proton is associated with several water molecules in a cluster, rather than attached to a single molecule. As such, H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup> is a simplified notation to represent this result. Similarly, the A<sup class="sup">-</sup>(aq) ion is solvated by several water molecules. Reaction (1) is referred to as "acid ionization."</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp19474976">Reaction (1) implies that a 0.1 M solution of the acid HA in water should produce H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions in solution with a concentration of 0.1 M. In fact, the concentration of H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions, [H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>], can be measured by a variety of techniques. Chemists commonly use a measure of the H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup> ion concentration called the pH, defined by:</p>

      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp24215920">Note that there are several acids listed for which [H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>] = 0.1 M, and pH = 1. This shows that, for these acids, the acid ionization is complete: essentially every acid molecule is ionized in the solution according to Reaction (1). However, there are other acids listed for which [H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>] is considerably less than 0.1 M and the pH is considerably greater than 1. For each of these acids, therefore, not all of the acid molecules ionize according to Reaction (1). In fact, it is clear in Table 1 that in these acids the vast majority of the acid molecules do not ionize, and only a small percentage does ionize.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp20227760">From these observations, we distinguish two classes of acids: "strong acids" and "weak acids." Strong acids are those for which nearly 100% of the acid molecules ionize, whereas weak acids are those for which only a small percentage of molecules ionize. There are seven strong acids listed in Table 1. From many observations, it is possible to determine that these seven acids are the only commonly observed strong acids. Otherwise, the vast majority of all substances with acidic properties are weak acids. We seek to characterize weak acid ionization quantitatively and to determine what the differences in molecular properties are between strong acids and weak acids.</p>

      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp25100976">Surprisingly, perhaps, the percent ionization varies considerably as a function of the concentration of the nitrous acid. We recall that this means that the fraction of molecules which ionize, according to Reaction (2), depends on how many acid molecules there are per liter of solution. Since some but not all of the acid molecules are ionized, this means that nitrous acid molecules are present in solution at the same time as the negative nitrite ions and the positive hydrogen ions. Recalling our observation of equilibrium in gas phase reactions, we can conclude that Reaction (2) achieves equilibrium for each concentration of the nitrous acid.</p>

It might seem that this would make no sense, as we would expect [H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>] to equal zero exactly in pure water. Surprisingly, this is incorrect: a measurement on pure water at 25 &#186;C yields pH = 7, so that [H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>] = 1.0&#183;10<sup class="sup">-7</sup> M.

      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp22330416">Reaction (6) occurs in pure water but must also occur when ions are dissolved in aqueous solutions.

We note two things from this observation: first, the value of [OH<sup class="sup">-</sup>] is considerably less than in pure water; second, the autoionization equilibrium constant remains the same at 1.0&#183;10<sup class="sup">-14</sup>. From these notes, we can conclude that the autoionization equilibrium of water occurs in acid solution, but the extent of autoionization is suppressed by the presence of the acid in solution.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp25952144">We consider a final note on the autoionization of water. The pH of pure water is 7 at 25 &#8595;C. Adding any acid to pure water, no matter how weak the acid, must increase [H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup>], thus producing a pH below 7. As such, we can conclude that, for all acid solutions at 25 &#8595;C, their pH is less than 7, or in other words, any solution with pH less than 7 is acidic.</p>

The pH for each solution is also listed in Table 6. The source of these H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions must be the autoionization of water. Note, however, that in each case in basic solution, the concentration of H<sub class="sub">3</sub>O<sup class="sup">+</sup> ions is less than that in pure water. Hence, the presence of the base in solution has suppressed the autoionization. Because of this, in each case the pH of a basic solution is greater than 7.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp22323856">Base ionization is therefore quite analogous to acid ionization observed earlier. We now consider a comparison of the strength of an acid to the strength of a base. To do so, we consider a class of reactions called "neutralization reactions," which occur when we mix an acid solution with a base solution. Since the acid donates protons and the base accepts protons, we might expect, when mixing acid and base, to achieve a solution which is no longer acidic or basic. For example, if we mix together equal volumes of 0.1 M HCl(aq) and 0.1 M NaOH(aq), the following reaction occurs:</p>

      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp27633968">We next consider mixing together a weak acid solution with a strong base solution, again with equal molar quantities of acid and base. As an example, we mix 100 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH<sub class="sub">3</sub>COOH) solution with 100 mL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide.

Thus, mixing equal molar quantities of strong base with weak acid produces a basic solution. In essence, the weak acid does not fully neutralize the strong base. To understand this, we examine the behavior of sodium acetate in solution. Since the pH is greater than 7, then there is an excess of OH<sup class="sup">-</sup> ions in solution relative to pure water.

      <h1>Observation 5: Acid strength and molecular properties</h1>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp17828336">We now have a fairly complete quantitative description of acid-base equilibrium. To complete our understanding of acid-base equilibrium, we need a predictive model which relates acid strength or base strength to molecular properties. In general, we expect that the strength of an acid is related either to the relative ease by which it can donate a hydrogen ion or by the relative stability of the remaining negative ion formed after the departure of the hydrogen ion.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp19465280">To begin, we note that there are three basic categories of acids that we have examined in this study. First, there are simple binary acids: HF, HCl, HBr, and HI. Second, there are acids formed from main group elements combined with one or more oxygen atoms, such H<sub class="sub">2</sub>SO<sub class="sub">4</sub> or HNO<sub class="sub">3</sub>. These are called "oxyacids." Third, there are the "carboxylic acids," organic molecules which contain the carboxylic functional group:</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp39123360">We consider first the simple binary acids. HCl, HBr, and HI are all strong acids, whereas HF is a weak acid. In comparing the experimental values of pK<sub class="sub">a</sub> values in Table 7, we note that the acid strength increases in the order HF&lt;HCl&lt;HBr&lt;HI. This means that the hydrogen ion can more readily separate from the covalent bond with the halogen atom (X) as we move down the periodic table. This is reasonable, because the strength of the H-X bond also decreases as we move down the periodic table, as shown in Table 7:</p>

      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp32891248">The decreasing strength of the H-X bond is primarily due to the increase is the size of the X atom as we move down the periodic table. We conclude that one factor which influences acidity is the strength of the H-X bond: a weaker bond produces a stronger acid, and vice versa.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp26176544">In the acids of the other two categories, the hydrogen atom that ionizes is attached directly to an oxygen atom. Thus, to understand acidity in these molecules, we must examine what the oxygen atom is in turn bonded to. It is very interesting to note that, in examining compounds like R-O-H, where R is an atom or group of atoms, we can get either acidic or basic properties. As examples, NaOH is a strong base, whereas HOCl is a weak acid. This means that, when NaOH ionizes in solution, the Na-O linkage ionizes, whereas when HOCl ionizes in solution, the H-O bond ionizes.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp26176224">To understand this behavior, we compare the strength of the simple oxyacids HOI, HOBr, and HOCl. The pK<sub class="sub">a</sub>s for these acids are found experimentally to be, respectively, 10.6, 8.6, and 7.5. The acid strength for HOX increases as we move up the periodic table in the halogen group. This means that the H-O bond ionizes more readily when the oxygen atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp36972640">We can add to this observation by comparing the strengths of the acids HOCl, HOClO, HOClO<sub class="sub">2</sub>, and HOClO<sub class="sub">3</sub>. (Note that the molecular formulae are more commonly written as HClO, HClO<sub class="sub">2</sub>, HClO<sub class="sub">3</sub>, and HClO<sub class="sub">4</sub>. We have written them instead to emphasize the molecular structure.) The pK<sub class="sub">a</sub>'s of these acids are, respectively, 7.5, 2.0, -2.7, and -8.0. In each case, the molecule with more oxygen atoms on the central Cl atom is the stronger acid: HOClO is more acidic than HOCl, etc. A similar result is found in comparing the oxyacids of nitrogen. HONO<sub class="sub">2</sub>, nitric acid, is one of the strong acids, whereas HONO, nitrous acid, is a weak acid. Since oxygen atoms are very strongly electronegative, these trends add to our observation that increasing the electronegativity of the attached atoms increases the ionization of the O-H bond.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp26517520">Why would electronegativity play a role in acid strength? There are two conclusions we might draw. First, a greater electronegativity of the atom or atoms attached to the H-O in the oxyacid apparently results in a weaker H-O bond, which is thus more readily ionized. We know that an electronegative atom polarizes bonds by drawing the electrons in the molecule towards it. In this case, the Cl in HOCl and the Br in HOBr must polarize the H-O bond, weakening it and facilitating the ionization of the hydrogen. In comparing HOCl to HOClO, the added oxygen atom must increase the polarization of the H-O bond, thus weakening the bond further and increasing the extent of ionization.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp20962480">A second conclusion has to do with the ion created by the acid ionization. The negative ion produced has a surplus electron, and the relative energy of this ion will depend on how readily that extra electron is attracted to the atoms of the ion. The more electronegative those atoms are, the stronger is the attraction. Therefore, the OCl<sup class="sup">-</sup> ion can more readily accommodate the negative charge than can the OBr<sup class="sup">-</sup> ion. And the OClO<sup class="sup">-</sup> ion can more readily accommodate the negative charge than can the OCl<sup class="sup">-</sup> ion.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp30185824">We conclude that the presence of strongly electronegative atoms in an oxyacid increases the polarization of the H-O bond, thus facilitating ionization of the acid, and increases the attraction of the extra electron to the negative ion, thus stabilizing the negative ion. Both of these factors increase the acid strength. Chemists commonly use both of these conclusions in understanding and predicting relative acid strength.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp31912592">The relative acidity of carbon compounds is a major subject of organic chemistry, which we can only visit briefly here. In each of the carboxylic acids, the H-O group is attached to a carbonyl C=O group, which is in turn bonded to other atoms. The comparison we observe here is between carboxylic acid molecules, denoted as RCOOH, and other organic molecules containing the H-O group, such as alcohols denoted as ROH. (R is simply an atom or group of atoms attached to the functional group.) The former are obviously acids whereas the latter group contains molecules which are generally extremely weak acids. One interesting comparison is for the acid and alcohol when R is the benzene ring, C<sub class="sub">6</sub>H<sub class="sub">5</sub>. Benzoic acid, C<sub class="sub">6</sub>H<sub class="sub">5</sub>COOH, has pK<sub class="sub">a</sub>= 4.2, whereas phenol, C<sub class="sub">6</sub>H<sub class="sub">5</sub>OH, has pK<sub class="sub">a</sub> = 9.9. Thus, the presence of the doubly bonded oxygen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the O-H clearly increases the acidity of the molecule, and thus increases ionization of the O-H bond.</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp31912848">This observation is quite reasonable in the context of our previous conclusion. Adding an electronegative oxygen atom in near proximity to the O-H bond both increases the polarization of the O-H bond and stabilizes the negative ion produced by the acid ionization. In addition to the electronegativity effect, carboxylate anions, RCOO<sup class="sup">-</sup>, exhibit resonance stabilization:</p>
      <p class="para" id="import-auto-idp75957520">The resonance results in a sharing of the negative charge over several atoms, thus stabilizing the negative ion. This is a major contributing factor in the acidity of carboxylic acids versus alcohols.</p>
